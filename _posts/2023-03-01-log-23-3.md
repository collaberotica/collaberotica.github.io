## 16

##### Single-chapter stories now sync tags with their chapter

- Otherwise they could have different tags
- This only applies when: the story is linear, it has only one chapter, and the chapter is designated as "the end"

## 14

##### Separated first-chapter creation from story creation

- First-chapters no longer have arbitrarily fewer options available

##### Updated search result design

- Before:

- After:

<img src="/assets/img/323s2.png" width="400px" alt="search after">

## 10

##### Registration opened
