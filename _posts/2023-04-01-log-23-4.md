## April 8, 2023 - New Editor!

This is a big one. After careful consideration, we changed the rich text editor used throughout the site.

The new editor, [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/tinymce/), gives you way more style and formatting options than before, so it will be much easier to get your story to look the way you like. Also, copying and pasting content from other editors, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, should be much more accurate.

This is a very big change across the site. The way rich text content is presented has been changed everywhere. Of course, we've taken great care to ensure that anything written with the old editor was not changed. **If you run into any issues, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://collaberotica.org/tos/contact)**. 
Community discussion, as always, will be on our [Discord](https://collaberotica.org/discord).

Thanks again for choosing Collaberotica. We're thrilled to grow with you!
