## April 4
### ‚ú® Changes ‚ú® 
- Lots of quality-of-life changes for Search
    - Search text is now optional (`*` is no longer used)
    - You can now search for exact phrases
    - The results section now has a description of what was searched for
    - Search-dropdown sections (tags, stories, users, series) are bigger
- Added a simple, dedicated "recent chapters" page for stories. The link is in the recent chapters section when you look at a story's introduction page
- Some CSS adjustments

### üêû Bugfixes üêû 

- Searching for chapters limited to your follows now works as expected. (Unless you expected it to not work. Then it's broken!)
    - Results will filtered to chapters either: written by authors you
      follow, or within stories you follow
- fixed some icons on mobile
- performance issues
